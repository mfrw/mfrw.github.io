After repeated feedback from mentors and friends, I have finally started to write again!
After a few (failed) attempts to resurruct my old blog, I finally gave up and started looking for a distraction free way of putting my thoughts in a coherent manner. I am taking a liking in the simplicity of tatic site generators. Hopefully, I, will now write more -- after I settle on what & where I host my blog.

Current ideas:

- [hugo](https://gohugo.io)
- [zola](https://getzola.org)

One is written in go & the other is in rust. Given my love for both the languages, its going to be hard to choose one. I am biased towards the simplicity of zola.

In anycase, enough of me blabering about what will I do and what not, let me get back to work and host a blog!
