A pure terminal geek, with interests in Parallel & Distriuted Systems.
I am currently working with <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/sambuddhochakravarty/">Dr. Sambhudo Chakravarty</a> on anonymous VoIP calling.
I have had experiences in playing with the source code of the Linux Kernel, LLVM, Docker and gcc. My current favorite language is <b> golang</b>
apart from <b>C</b>. A religious <b> vim </b> user, but occasionally break out <b>emacs</b>, if its too complex for vi.
These days I am fascinated by the design of the <b> go compiler </b>, which keeps me awake at non-normal hours with a constant supply
of caffiene. Additional academic information can be found on my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a>.
Did I mention, I am fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>.<br>
A firm believer in the <b> UNIX Philosphy</b>, so much so that I have to admit my admiration and respect
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a> for
<a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix"> UNIX </a> & <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language) ">C</a>.
I won't forget to pay homage to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">Doug McIlroy</a> who gave us the |<a href="pipe.pdf">pipe</a>|<br>
My minimalist asthetic sense is a consequence of my beliefs, which has made me better understand the quote <i>"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"</i> <p>

I am currently the <b> Teaching Assistant </b> for the course <b> CSE 545: Foundations of Computer Security </b> instructed by <a href="http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~arunb/">Dr. Arun Balaji</a>.
