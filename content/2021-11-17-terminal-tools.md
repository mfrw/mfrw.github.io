The terminal is a power-tool, but it does not work out of the box. My day-job as well as my hobby project workflow is entirely driven from the terminal.
I always am in search of small quality of life improvments in my setup and try to keep things dynamic.
This is like a win-win situation for a person like me, who enjoys automating anything trivial. Ofcourse, I am not saying I am competing with [hacker-scripts](insert-url), but I try my fair share of it.

I wanted to document, for nobody, acutally but for my own self, my terminal setup at this point in time. I hope when I read this again after some decent span of time, my work-flow would have gone better
and it would give a sense of satisaction that I improved!

So without further ado, lets try to break down this blog post and try to talk about a few tools/configs that I feel should be used.


## Basics

## Intermediate
