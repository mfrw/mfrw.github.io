Getting to the world of RSS and getting on top of my blog reading game is just insane. I never had used an RSS reader before but now using one for just a few hours, I am starting to realize what I was missing in life. I like to think of myself as someone, who would read a lot (not sure if i can apply all of that), but for sure I try to read a lot. Right now I am trying to slurp the `nix` manual. It just feels like something I can really use with whatever I am doing currently.

Hopefully a blog on nix is in order!


Thats it for today though.
