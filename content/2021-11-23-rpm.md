I have been playing with RPM a lot lately. Do I like them ? Do I have fun while packaging stuff? Well in all honesty, nope, not at all, but I am learning new tricks to get more out of the RPM system.

Recently I have been involved with getting some information from specs files and also from the generated RPMS.

So, here, just for my own self, let me try to pen down a few tricks that i like to use with RPM.

## Extract all the packages that are provided by a given RPM:

```bash
 rpm -qp --qf '[%{N} \\n]' --nosignature some.rpm
 ```

 The above command if broken down, if provided a `--query-format/--qf` which return whatever you ask from the RPM. In the above command, my question is simple, what packages are provided by the given RPM, without the `version/distro-tag/` or any other BS.

 We could have asked the same question to a `.spec` file as well

 ```bash
 rpmspec -q --queryformat '[%{N} \\n]' some.spec
 ```

 To get all possible values of what can be given in the `--queryformat`, well, ask `rpm/rpmspec`

 ```bash
 rpmspec --querytags
 ```
 Most of the values there are self-explainatory!
